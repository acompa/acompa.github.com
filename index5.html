        <h1><a href="/beyond-trending-topics.html">Beyond Trending Topics: identifying important conversations in communities</a></h1>
        <p>Last summer, while at Betaworks, <a href="http://twitter.com/rj_here">Rohit Jain</a> and I co-wrote a blog
post on detecting trending topics. Here's a blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://scalemodel.com">Scale Model</a>, one of the newest companies to launch out of betaworks, helps
identify, follow and reach communities on Twitter. While there’s a great
visual dashboard that gives us a way to look at what’s bubbling up from
within communities, it is still hard to evaluate which items appear on a
regular basis, and which are more unique. For example, in the <a href="http://scalemodel.com/dashboard/33/">US politics</a>
model, the <a href="http://scalemodel.com/dashboard/shares/33/hashtags/WakeUpAmerica">#WakeUpAmerica</a> hashtag is used on a regular basis by conservatives,
hence appears on the dashboard quite often. Wouldn’t it be great to know when
activity around a certain hashtag is unique? Or more specifically, deviates
from the expected behavior? Since we can’t expect users to be continuously
glued to our dashboard, it’d be great if we could send out notifications
whenever something important happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rohit and I spent quite a bit of time discussing time series decomposition and
the messier parts of working with short-form text pulled from social network
activity. I especially liked the use of a chat bot to check the output of a key model. Rohit
deserves full credit for that great idea (as well as the rest of the working code).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this work made it into Scale Model or any of the tooling they
offer to their clients -- I left before I could convert Rohit's prototype to
a working service -- but this is definitely a problem Frank and his team
continue to work on.</p>
<p>Head on over to <a href="http://data.betaworks.com/beyond-trending-topics-identifying-important-conversations-in-communities/">the full post</a>
