I'm from Miami, but right now I'm a [grad student in computer science](http://cs.nyu.edu/) in New York studying statistics, machine learning algorithms, and math. At [Knewton](http://www.knewton.com) I work on projects that use data and code to improve students' learning experiences.

In my spare time I play soccer, write, hang out with [this wonderful woman](http://twitter.com/regipink24), and cheer for a [bunch](http://gatorzone.com/) of [sports](http://miamidolphins.com/) [teams](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/). One of them is my alma mater! (Hint: I am not from Spain or the ocean). 

You can see some of my code via the link to Github at the top, or use the link to Quora to see some of the things I find interesting. If you want to chat, just use the LinkedIn or Twitter links down there.
