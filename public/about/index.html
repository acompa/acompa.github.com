<p>I'm from Miami, but right now I'm a <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/">grad student in computer science</a> in New York studying statistics, machine learning algorithms, and math. At <a href="http://www.knewton.com">Knewton</a> I work on projects that use data and code to improve students' learning experiences.</p>

<p>In my spare time I play soccer, write, hang out with <a href="http://twitter.com/regipink24">this wonderful woman</a>, and cheer for a <a href="http://gatorzone.com/">bunch</a> of <a href="http://miamidolphins.com/">sports</a> <a href="http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/">teams</a>. One of them is my alma mater! (Hint: I am not from Spain or the ocean).</p>

<p>You can see some of my code via the link to Github at the top, or use the link to Quora to see some of the things I find interesting. If you want to chat, just use the LinkedIn or Twitter links down there.</p>
