        <h1><a href="http://acompa.net/presenting-leptoid-at-surge-2012.html">Presenting leptoid at Surge 2012</a></h1>
        <p>I spent my summer at Knewton working on an autoscaling project. I learned a lot along the way about capacity planning, queuing theory, code instrumentation, and server management and deployment, and I recently presented about what I learned at <a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012">Surge Conference 2012</a>.</p>
<p>The talk focused on instrumentation more than anything else, and you can check out the slides <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7wcaj6c892we2n5/Autoscaling%20with%20Leptoid-Final.pdf">here</a>. If capacity planning sounds interesting, we also open-sourced leptoid -- the autoscaling library I worked on -- so that you could review the source on <a href="https://github.com/knewton/leptoid">Github</a>.</p>
<p>I also had a chance to speak with two excellent guys, Nathan Harvey and Dave Zwieback, for <a href="http://foodfightshow.org/2012/09/surge-update-knewton.html">an interview</a> on Food Fight. During that interview I talked about my Surge presentation and experiences as a junior engineer at Knewton.</p>
<p>During my talk I mentioned the unimportance of a good capacity forecasting model relative to good instrumentation and deployment practices. This was revelatory. I actually spent the majority of my summer outside of my machine learning &amp; statistical wheelhouse, instead working on this autoscaling project with Knewton's systems team. Lots of time went into</p>
<ul>
<li>instrumenting code with <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">statsd</a> and Coda Hale's <a href="https://github.com/codahale/metrics">metrics</a></li>
<li>managing a cluster of <a href="https://github.com/graphite-project">Graphite</a> hosts</li>
<li>fumbling around with <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That list of items looks really obnoxious, I know, but I don't want to forget about them. I simultaneously studied operating systems at NYU during this project, and have a list of topics I'd like to dig into once things slow down:</p>
<ul>
<li>scheduling and thread prioritization (beyond aging and "NRU" scheduling algorithms)</li>
<li>networking, especially DNS lookups and comparisons between proxies</li>
<li>sharding (or distributed storage, especially w.r.t something like HDFS)</li>
<li>kernel v. user modes, and how they work in practice</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, I feel like a better developer after this summer. It was an excellent experience, and Dave and Peter Norton (who really needs to get on Twitter or Pinterest or something) were excellent mentors.</p>
